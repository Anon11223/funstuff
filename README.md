<h2>Image Blending </h2>
<p>This is also image addition, but different weights are given to images so that it gives a feeling of blending or transparency. Images are added as per the equation below:</p>
<p> g(x)=(1−α)f0(x)+αf1(x) </p>

<p>By varying α from 0→1, you can perform a cool transition between one image to another.</p>
<p>Here I took an image below to blend it with a video below . First image is given a weight of 0.5 and video is given 0.5 <a class="el" </p>
